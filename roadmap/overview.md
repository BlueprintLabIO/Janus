# Janus Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

Janus is an open source, self-hostable AI teammate framework designed to provide human-like productivity and intelligence. This roadmap outlines our development strategy for a 5-contributor team over 6-9 months to create a production-ready system.

## Development Philosophy

### Start Simple, Build Incrementally
- Prove core concept with minimal viable product
- Add complexity only after validating fundamental architecture
- Each development phase produces a working, deployable system
- Focus on clean interfaces to enable parallel development

### Interface-First Development
- Define component APIs before implementation begins
- Mock dependencies to unblock parallel development streams
- Regular integration testing to catch interface mismatches early
- Maintain backward compatibility across minor version updates

### Quality Gates
- All pull requests require review from component owner + one additional reviewer
- Automated testing must pass before merge approval
- Documentation updates mandatory for user-facing changes
- Performance regression testing for critical system paths

## Team Structure & Coordination

### Roles and Responsibilities

**Core Maintainer**
- Architecture decisions and technical direction
- Pull request reviews and merge authority
- Release management and version coordination
- Community leadership and strategic planning

**Component Leads (2-3 contributors)**
- Own specific system modules and their evolution
- Design and maintain component APIs
- Review pull requests for their areas of expertise
- Mentor contributors working on their components

**Feature Contributors (1-2 contributors)**
- Implement features according to specifications
- Write comprehensive tests for implemented functionality
- Create and maintain documentation for user-facing features
- Support community users and address issues

### Development Workflow

**Communication Channels**
- Weekly 30-minute video synchronization calls
- GitHub Projects kanban board with component swim lanes
- Slack/Discord for real-time coordination
- RFC (Request for Comments) process for major architectural changes

**Quality Assurance Process**
- Component-based code ownership with clear responsibility boundaries
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive test suite
- Code review requirements with emphasis on architecture consistency
- Performance benchmarking and regression detection

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (2-3 months)
**Goal**: Prove core concept with working AI teammate

**Scope**
- Single input channel (Slack integration)
- Basic orchestrator with simple LLM integration
- Vector-based memory system for conversation history
- Essential tools (web search, file operations, API calls)
- Simple output formatting and error handling
- Basic observability (logging and request tracing)

**Success Criteria**
- Handle Slack messages with contextual responses
- Remember conversation history across interactions
- Execute tools and integrate results into responses
- Maintain 99% uptime for core functionality
- Achieve <5 second response time for basic queries
- Reach 80%+ user satisfaction on simple tasks

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (2-3 months)
**Goal**: Add sophisticated AI capabilities and extensibility

**Scope**
- Sparse Mixture of Agents implementation
- Graph database integration for relationship modeling
- Advanced memory consolidation and learning capabilities
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool integration
- Multiple LLM provider support with intelligent routing
- Enhanced observability with decision audit trails

**Success Criteria**
- Demonstrate emergent intelligence through agent collaboration
- Show learning and adaptation over multiple interactions
- Successfully integrate external tools via MCP protocol
- Maintain response quality while adding complexity
- Achieve cost optimization through intelligent model selection

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (2-3 months)
**Goal**: Enterprise-ready deployment with full feature set

**Scope**
- Multiple input/output channels (API, GitHub, email)
- Proactive intelligence with predictive capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
- Professional identity system with adaptive communication
- Performance optimization and horizontal scaling
- Security hardening and compliance features

**Success Criteria**
- Support multiple deployment scenarios and use cases
- Demonstrate proactive value through predictive assistance
- Meet enterprise security and compliance requirements
- Achieve production-level performance and reliability
- Complete documentation for administrators and developers

## Component Assignment Strategy

### Contributor Skill Mapping

**Backend/Infrastructure Focused**
- Core orchestrator development and optimization
- Memory system architecture and performance
- Database integration and data modeling
- System reliability and performance optimization

**API/Integration Specialist**
- Input processing and adapter development
- Output formatting and delivery systems
- Tool framework and MCP protocol integration
- External system integration and webhooks

**Frontend/Experience Designer**
- User interface and interaction design
- Documentation and tutorial creation
- Community examples and use case development
- User experience testing and feedback integration

**DevOps/Reliability Engineer**
- Monitoring and alerting system development
- Deployment automation and infrastructure management
- Testing framework and quality assurance
- Security implementation and compliance

**AI/ML Researcher**
- Intelligence evaluation and benchmarking
- Model integration and performance optimization
- Learning system development and validation
- Research integration and capability expansion

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigate through strong interface contracts and early integration testing
- **Performance Scalability**: Address through benchmarking and performance testing from Phase 1
- **LLM Provider Dependencies**: Reduce through multi-provider support and fallback systems
- **Quality Consistency**: Manage through comprehensive testing and quality gate enforcement

### Project Risks
- **Contributor Availability**: Plan for 20% capacity buffer and flexible task allocation
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict phase boundaries and feature prioritization
- **Community Adoption**: Focus on documentation, examples, and responsive support
- **Technical Debt**: Allocate 20% of development time to refactoring and maintenance

## Success Metrics
