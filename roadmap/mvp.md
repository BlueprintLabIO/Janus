## Technical Implementation Priorities

### Architecture Decisions
**Keep It Simple**: Choose straightforward implementations over sophisticated solutions
**Prove the Concept**: Focus on demonstrating core value rather than optimizing performance
**Interface-First**: Define clean APIs even if implementation is simple
**Testable**: Ensure all components can be tested independently

### Technology Stack Recommendations
**Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript or Python for rapid development
**Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector storage
**LLM Integration**: Direct API calls to OpenAI or Anthropic
**Deployment**: Docker Compose for simplicity
**Testing**: Jest/pytest with good coverage for core logic

### Development Approach
**Vertical Slices**: Implement complete user journeys rather than horizontal layers
**Fail Fast**: Quick validation of architectural assumptions
**User Feedback**: Early and frequent user testing with real scenarios
**Iteration**: Plan for significant changes based on initial user feedback
