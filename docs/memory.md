# Memory Module

## Overview

The memory module provides contextual awareness and learning capabilities through hybrid storage across Vector DB, Graph DB, and working memory.

## Architecture

```
Memory Module
├── Vector Store (Pinecone/Weaviate)    # Semantic similarity search
├── Graph Store (Neo4j/ArangoDB)        # Entity relationships & patterns  
├── Working Memory (Redis)              # Active conversation context
└── Consolidator                        # Pattern recognition & learning
```

## Memory Types

- **Episodic**: Conversation history, task outcomes, user interactions
- **Semantic**: Facts, knowledge, learned patterns, preferences  
- **Procedural**: Successful workflows, tool usage patterns
- **Working**: Active context, current conversation state

## Key Responsibilities

### Storage
- Multi-modal memory persistence across vector and graph databases
- Rich metadata tagging (timestamp, entities, success rate, cost)
- Automatic entity extraction and relationship building

### Retrieval  
- **Hybrid Search**: Vector similarity + Graph traversal + Working memory
- **Context-Aware**: Uses conversation history and user patterns
- **Multi-Source Fusion**: Intelligent ranking and deduplication

### Consolidation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Extract reusable workflows from successful interactions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle contradictory information intelligently
- **Memory Decay**: Manage storage limits based on relevance and usage

## API Contract

```javascript
// Store memory
await memoryAPI.remember({
  type: 'procedural',
  content: 'Deployment workflow: git push → CI → staging',
  conversation_id: 'conv_123',
  entities: ['git', 'CI', 'staging'],
  success: true,
  tools_used: ['git', 'ci_cd']
});

// Retrieve relevant memories
const memories = await memoryAPI.recall({
  query: 'How do we deploy to staging?',
  types: ['procedural', 'episodic'],
  conversation_id: 'conv_123',
  limit: 10
});
```

## Design Principles

- **Hybrid Storage**: Leverage strengths of both vector and graph databases
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Surface relevant memories based on current situation
- **Continuous Learning**: Build knowledge from successful interactions
- **Intelligent Decay**: Retain important memories, forget irrelevant ones
- **Multi-Modal**: Support text, structured data, and relationship storage
