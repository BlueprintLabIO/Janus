# Observability Module

## Overview

The observability module provides complete system traceability, decision transparency, and explainability across all Janus components. It enables debugging, builds user trust through transparency, ensures compliance, and supports continuous system improvement.

## Design Principles

### Complete Traceability
- **Request Lifecycle Tracking**: Follow every request from input to output across all components
- **Decision Audit Trails**: Record why the orchestrator made specific choices at each decision point
- **Component Interaction Logging**: Track all inter-service communication and data flow
- **Performance Instrumentation**: Measure latency, cost, and resource utilization throughout the system

### Explainable Intelligence
- **Reasoning Chain Capture**: Record LLM reasoning processes and agent collaboration
- **Context Documentation**: Log what information influenced each decision
- **Uncertainty Tracking**: Capture confidence levels and areas of uncertainty
- **Human-Readable Explanations**: Transform technical logs into understandable narratives

### Privacy-Preserving Transparency
- **Selective Logging**: Configurable detail levels based on sensitivity and compliance needs
- **Data Anonymization**: Automatic scrubbing of PII while preserving debugging utility
