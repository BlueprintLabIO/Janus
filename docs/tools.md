Got it üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs sketch a **broader plugin API** that:

* Doesn‚Äôt force you into one ecosystem (like LangChain or OpenAI Assistants).
* Can host **MCP servers, REST tools, gRPC services, or even local scripts**.
* Defines a **common contract** so your orchestrator knows:

  * what the tool does,
  * how to call it,
  * what inputs/outputs look like,
  * how to handle errors/auth.

# üì¶ Plugin API Design

### 1. **Plugin Manifest (declarative metadata)**

Every plugin ships with a manifest (JSON/YAML) that describes itself:

```json
{
  "name": "release_notes_generator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Generate release notes from Jira tickets and Git commits",
  "author": "Acme Inc",
  "protocol": "rest",        // or "mcp" | "grpc" | "local"
  "entrypoint": "http://localhost:5001",
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "generateReleaseNotes",
      "description": "Summarize tickets and commits into release notes",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "projectId": { "type": "string" },
          "since": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
          "until": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" }
        },
        "required": ["projectId", "since", "until"]
      },
      "output_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "notes": { "type": "string" },
          "tickets": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "auth": {
    "type": "oauth2",
    "scopes": ["jira.read", "github.read"]
  }
}
```

---

### 2. **Plugin Runtime Protocols**

The orchestrator knows how to load plugins of different **protocols**:

* **REST** ‚Üí Call `POST /{endpoint}` with JSON payloads.
* **gRPC** ‚Üí Load protobuf definitions and call services.
* **MCP** ‚Üí Connect as an MCP client, treat server‚Äôs advertised tools as endpoints.
* **Local** ‚Üí Run a Node.js/Python function inside a sandbox (like serverless).

This means one plugin API ‚Üí multiple runtime backends.

---

### 3. **Orchestrator Execution Flow**

When an LLM or static policy says: *‚Äúuse `release_notes_generator.generateReleaseNotes`‚Äù*, the orchestrator:

1. Looks up plugin in **registry**.
2. Reads manifest ‚Üí knows protocol, entrypoint, input/output schemas.
3. Validates input payload against schema.
4. Executes call (REST/gRPC/MCP/local).
5. Validates response against schema.
6. Returns clean result (or error) to the orchestrator brain.

---

### 4. **Error Handling**

All tools respond with a **standard envelope**:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_FAILED",
    "message": "Invalid OAuth token"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": { "notes": "Release notes text..." }
}
```

---

### 5. **Plugin Registry**

Your orchestrator would maintain a **registry** like:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "release_notes_generator@1.0.0",
    "jira_connector@2.1.0",
    "confluence_writer@0.9.3"
  ]
}
```

And at runtime, LLMs can be prompted with tool definitions automatically pulled from this registry (like how OpenAI Assistants get ‚Äúfunction‚Äù descriptions).

---

# üöÄ Why This is Stronger than Today‚Äôs Ecosystems

* **Not locked in** ‚Üí works with MCP (future standard), but also REST/gRPC (enterprise reality).
* **Declarative schemas** ‚Üí tools self-describe, no hand-written wrappers needed.
* **Reusability** ‚Üí write a plugin once ‚Üí run it in your orchestrator, or in any MCP-based one.
* **Sandboxed execution** ‚Üí safe for local tools (like Zapier actions, but self-hosted).

---

# ‚ö° Bonus: Proactive Hooks

You could extend the manifest with **event hooks**:

```json
"events": [
  { "trigger": "jira.issue_created", "action": "generateReleaseNotes" }
]
```

So the proactive engine can auto-wire workflows without LLM involvement.

---

üëâ In short:

* This API is like **npm for AI teammates** ‚Üí a unified package system for tools.
* MCP becomes *one runtime option*, but not the only one.
* Your orchestrator becomes the **WordPress of AI teammates**.

---

Would you like me to show you how this would look **from the LLM‚Äôs perspective** (i.e., what prompt/tool definitions it sees so it knows how to call `release_notes_generator`)? That makes it clear how the ‚Äúplanning‚Äù side connects to the plugin API.
